# Tailwind CSS Gradient Rendering Issue

This repository demonstrates a bug where Tailwind CSS gradients may not render correctly in certain situations.  The issue seems related to CSS specificity or conflicting styles, causing the gradient to be overridden unintentionally.  The `bug.js` file contains an example of the problem, while `bugSolution.js` provides a potential solution.

## Reproducing the Bug

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `bug.js` and run it in a browser that supports Tailwind CSS (or a similar setup). 
3. Observe that the gradient background may not be applied correctly. 

## Solution

The solution involves carefully examining your CSS for conflicting styles and ensuring your Tailwind CSS configuration is correctly applied. The `bugSolution.js` file offers an example of how to solve this issue by addressing potential conflicts. This might involve using more specific selectors, adding !important (as a last resort), or double checking that you do not have conflicting style.
